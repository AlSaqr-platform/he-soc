# Al Saqr litmus tests

## Commands

- `make all`: run all tests and profile the execution
- `make profile`: alias for `all`
- `make run`: runs the available tests
- `make clean`: clean all files generated by the simulation

To execute a subset of tests use append `"TESTS=testname1 testname2 ..."` to the specific `make` target invoked (e.g. `make all "TESTS=write_shared write_hit_shared"`). Note that using the `-j` option to run parallel simulation is supported.
