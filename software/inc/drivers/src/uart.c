/**
 * Setup UART. The UART defaults to 8 bit character mode with 1 stop bit.
 *
 * parity       Enable/disable parity mode
 * clk_counter  Clock counter value that is used to derive the UART clock.
 *              It has to be in the range of 1..2^16.
 *              There is a prescaler in place that already divides the SoC
 *              clock by 16.  Since this is a counter, a value of 1 means that
 *              the SoC clock divided by 16*2 = 32 is used. A value of 31 would mean
 *              that we use the SoC clock divided by 16*32 = 512.
